# Khushnud Ahmed

Applied Data Scientist · Analytics Engineer  
Toronto, Canada 🇨🇦

I build **reliable analytics and predictive systems** that support business, risk, and operational decision-making.

I’ve worked across **Data Scientist and Data Analyst–style responsibilities**, depending on where the business needs the most signal.

My work focuses on **data correctness, scalability, and traceability** — designing clean analytics layers, warehouse-first pipelines, and applied machine learning workflows that hold up in regulated, production environments.

I’m comfortable owning systems end to end, from ingestion and modeling to reporting and evaluation, with a strong bias toward clarity and trust in the numbers.

## Current focus

- Designing **Snowflake-first analytics platforms** for revenue, orders, and operational KPIs  
- Building **well-modeled analytics layers** that power executive and regulatory reporting  
- Applying **machine learning selectively**, where it improves decisions rather than adds complexity  
- Delivering **production-grade pipelines** with monitoring, documentation, and clear ownership

## Selected Work

### 💰 Revenue & Orders Analytics Platform (Snowflake-first)
**Analytics Engineering · Cloud Warehouse · BI Enablement**

A production-style revenue analytics platform built entirely on Snowflake, modeled after real-world banking and fintech analytics workflows.

The platform ingests daily order data incrementally, maintains a clean analytics layer, tracks core revenue and volume KPIs, and monitors data freshness. This project intentionally avoids machine learning to emphasize **data quality, metric consistency, and stakeholder trust**.

**What this demonstrates**
- Warehouse-native incremental ingestion  
- Typed staging models with cleaning and deduplication  
- Analytics marts aligned to business KPIs  
- Snowflake tasks for scheduling and orchestration  
- BI-ready views designed for consistent reporting  

**Tech:** Snowflake, SQL (analytics engineering), Snowflake Tasks, BI-ready views

### 🏥 30-Day Hospital Readmission Prediction
**Applied Machine Learning · Risk-Oriented Analytics**

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict 30-day hospital readmissions using large-scale clinical data.

The project emphasizes evaluation rigor, interpretability, and imbalanced classification — mirroring how risk and propensity models are assessed in financial services.

**What this demonstrates**
- Full ML pipeline ownership  
- Careful handling of imbalanced outcomes  
- Model comparison and performance interpretation  
- Responsible application of predictive modeling  

**Tech:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SQL

### 🚀 Job Alert Automation Platform
**Automation · Data Pipelines · Reliability**

A production-oriented automation system built with reliability and noise reduction in mind.

Designed with deduplication, filtering, scheduling, and monitoring to surface only high-signal outputs. Structured as a maintainable pipeline rather than a one-off script.

**What this demonstrates**
- Automation with operational discipline  
- Monitoring and validation  
- Clear system boundaries and ownership  

**Tech:** Python, GitHub Actions, APIs, scheduling logic

## How I approach data work

- I prioritize **correct and explainable metrics**  
- I design models and pipelines around **business decisions**  
- I document assumptions and edge cases  
- I prefer **stable systems over fragile complexity**

If results can’t be trusted, they don’t matter.
